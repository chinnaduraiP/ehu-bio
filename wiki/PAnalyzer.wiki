#summary PAnalyzer: A protein inference tool for shotgun proteomics.
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

PAnalyzer uses as input protein identification files in mzIdentML (v1.0.0 and v1.1.0) or Waters PLGS formats and re-arranges the proteins into evidence categories according to their shared peptides.

Protein evidence categories considered are: conclusive, non conclusive, ambiguous group and indistinguishable proteins.

= Multiple replicate runs =

Multirun analysis is also supported and peptides are filtered if they are not present in a minimum number of replicate runs specified by the user. If all the peptides of a protein are filtered, the protein is also filtered.

= Output =

Results are saved to a CSV file (useful for processing using a spreadsheet) and an HTML report is also generated for allowing an easy browse. If a single mzIdentML file is used as input, an mzIdentML output is also generated.
