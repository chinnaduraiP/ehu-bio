#summary PAnalyzer: A protein inference tool for shotgun proteomics.
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

== Description ==

PAnalyzer uses as input protein identification files in mzIdentML (v1.0.0 and v1.1.0) or Waters PLGS formats and re-arranges the proteins into evidence categories according to their shared peptides.

Protein evidence categories considered are: conclusive, non conclusive, ambiguous group and indistinguishable proteins.

== Multiple replicate runs ==

Multirun analysis is also supported and peptides are filtered if they are not present in a minimum number of replicate runs specified by the user. If all the peptides of a protein are filtered, the protein is also filtered.

== Output ==

Results are saved to a CSV file (useful for processing using a spreadsheet) and an HTML report is also generated for allowing an easy browse. If a single mzIdentML file is used as input, an mzIdentML output is also generated.

= Installation =

== .NET ==

PAnalyzer requires .NET version 4. If you are using Windows, you can download the Microsoft runtime from:

Or you can install the free mono implementation for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux:

== GTK# ==

PAnalyzer uses GTK# for the graphical user interface. You can download it from:

== PAnalyzer ==

Just download the latest version, unzip and execute!

= User instructions =

*Open* one or more protein identification files. Multiple files can be selected by holding the _Ctrl_ key while clicking them.

Wait until PAnalyzer loads and validates the data and then click *Execute* to enter the analysis parameters dialog (only shown if applicable).

Now you can browse the peptide and re-arranged protein list from the user interface, but probably you prefer using the HTML output report. To generate it just click *Save* and select the destination directory and file name.
