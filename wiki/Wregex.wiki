Wregex (weighted regular expression) offers a new approach for amino acid motif searching. Wregex combines a regular expression with an optional Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM). The regular expression is used to obtain a candidate list matching the desired conditions, and the PSSM is used for computing a score that can be used to select the most promising of those candidates.

For direct use, please go to the official Wregex website http://wregex.ehubio.es.
