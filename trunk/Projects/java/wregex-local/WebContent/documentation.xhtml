		<p>Wregex (weighted regular expression) offers a new approach for amino acid motif searching. Wregex
		combines a regular expression with an optional Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM). The regular
		expression is used to obtain a candidate list matching the desired conditions, and the PSSM
		is used for computing a score that can be used to select the most promising of those candidates.</p>
		<p>Wregex supports all motifs in <a href="http://elm.eu.org/">ELM</a> as regular expressions, and
		a PSSM has already been builded for some of them. In the case your motif is not included in the list
		or a PSSM is not available, you can easily build your own as detailed later. Then you can also notify us
		your motif definition by sending a mail to <a href="mailto:wregex@ehubio.es">wregex@ehubio.es</a> and we will be
		happy to include it in the default motif list used in the basic search.</p>
		
		<h3><a id="search">Basic Search</a></h3>		
		<p>The basic search consists on searching a fasta file with protein sequences (provided by the user)
		for an amino acid motif selected in the dropdown lists (provided by Wregex). The first dropdown list
		contains the motifs available, and the second dropdown list (the one to the right) allows the user
		to select a specific motif configuration (different regular expressions and/or PSSMs).</p>
		<p>The dropdown list containing the motifs is divided in two parts, the first one contains entries
		specific of Wregex for which both a regular expression and a PSSM are available. The second part consists
		on <a href="http://elm.eu.org/">ELM</a> entries without a PSSM.</p>
		<p>Once a motif has been selected and an input fasta file uploaded, a search button will be shown. Clicking
		this button starts a new search and a list of candidates will be shown when finished (if there is any match).</p>
		<p>The grouping checkbox allows to configure whether overlapping candidates should be considered as
		a single entry or separated into multiple entries. An overlap occurs when there are several combinations
		that match the regular expression in the same region of the protein.</p>				
		<img src="/resources/tutorial/Results.png" align="right"/>
		<p>Results can be downloaded as a CSV file, useful for further analysis using any spreadsheet, or as
		a Clustal ALN file, which can be used to display the alignments of the results using the groups indicated
		between parenthesis () in the regular expression. These results are also displayed on a table with the following
		columns: protein accession/entry from the fasta header, starting and ending positions of the candidate motif within
		the protein sequence, candidate motif sequence with the regular expression groups indicated between dashes --,
		number of combinations grouped in the same entry (overlapping positions) and Wregex score. Finally, if there
		are motif annotations with scores in the input fasta sequences, their score is also displayed as the assay score.</p>
